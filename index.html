            My mission in 2022 is to become a full-stack web developer. I know
            that programming is not an easy task. But I will do my best to
            improve my development skill. My primary focus in 2022 is to work
            hard to become a web developer.

            Without Limits
          </h3>

          <p>
            We can choose to overcome some of the limits while embracing others.
            Having time limits, dealing with dependencies and a broken software
            design, having to learn new skills every day to keep up with the
            advances in technology, finding smart ways to fight enterprise
            politics and hardware limitations with limited money is what makes
            our job interesting and rewarding. As engineers, we are not the kind
            of people who like things to be easy, trying to break the limits is
            what drives us to do our best every day.

          <p>
            Communities are the collaborative platform for the tech-savvy,
            expert, competent, and beginner. Where knowledge, individual
            experience, failures, and skills to be shared to help all other
            members. When people ask me what the biggest trend on the web is, I
            tell them globalization. Web services are being used globally and
            they are increasingly being built globally. There is no place in the
            world that has a lock on talent, ideas, and execution. Web
            development is a global phenomenon.Web developer communities that
            every developer should join are StackOverflow, GitHub, Hackernoon,
            Hashnode, HackerNews, FreeCodeCamp, Dev, CodeProject, IndieHackers,
            Medium etc.

            According to NASA, 17 out of the 18 warmest years on record have all
            occurred since 2001 and carbon dioxide levels in the air are at
            their highest in 650,000 years. These statistics are daunting as
            climate change worsens every year. Luckily, mobile apps are able to
            help with environmental awareness and to fight global warming.
            Whether itâ€™s an app for tracking air quality, pollution or water
            consumption, smartphone technology allows people to play their part
            in helping to save the planet. These apps contain functions like
            promoting greener lifestyles, tips about cutting down on CO2
            emissions as well as other steps to becoming more eco-friendly.
